                    <p>Steers is one of South Africa's most recognizable quick-service restaurant brands. The company is well known for serving burgers and chips. Other menu items include chicken burgers, ribs as well as ice
                         cream and milkshakes.</p>
                    <p>The history of the company revolves around the Halamandaris family, whose family members are still part of the executive team today, with extensive experience in the food and 
                        franchising industries.</p> 
                    <p>Steers founder, George Halamandress had a vision to create a successful family-run business and the idea for Steers originated while he was on holiday in the United States where he came across innovative food industry concepts and ideas. He decided to bring these new food industry methods to South Africa, which was the starting point for the creation of a brand that would grow from strength
                         to strength. </p>
