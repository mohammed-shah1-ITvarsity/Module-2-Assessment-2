                    <h3>INCREDIBLE CONNECTION</h3>
                    <p>Software connection was founded in 1989 by entrepreneurs Michael Glezerson (Australia) and Michael David Smith (Australia). The initial store was located in 
                        Sandton City, Johannesburg.</p>
                    <p>In 1995 the first Incredible connection opened in Woodmead, Johannesburg. The company is now the largest consumer electronics and IT retailer in South Africa
                         and the African continent.</p> 
                    <p> On 15 December 1998, Incredible Connection was acquired by Connection Group Holdings Limited and now operates as subsidiary of that company, itself a subsidiary of JD Group Limited. As of 2018, Incredible Connection has 78 retail outlets in
                         southern Africa, up from 34 in 2005.</p>
